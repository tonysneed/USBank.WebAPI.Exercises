Certificate Usage:

1. SSL Certificate for your Web API
   - Secures client to Web API transport
   - Protect access token:
     privacy (encryption)
     integrity, replay (signing)
   
2. STS Signing Certificate
   - Web API needs to validate tokens against
     STS signing cert's public key
     
3. Optional: Client Certificates
   - Instead of passing username / password 
     to the STS for credentials, pass the
     client certificate (thumbprint)
     > STS checks client certificate to see if
       it is in its data store
